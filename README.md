- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @marijn2112 or normally known as marijn211
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in history, politics, music and tech, if you need to know what parts to get for a gaming PC I'm the guy to ask.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™ve learned Python and C++ in school, in my free time I've used LUA to mod PAYDAY 2, proprietary code for Paradox games and I created some modding utilities based on Python and Batch.
- ðŸ”¨ I contribute to the Road to 56 mod for HOI IV and previously (for the most part) created many mods for PAYDAY 2 and a couple for Fallout 3/NV/4 among others.
I would like to make Bannerlord, Rimworld and Freeman Guerrila Warfare mods but they are very difficult to mod compared to most games.

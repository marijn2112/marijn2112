- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @marijn2112 or normally known as marijn211
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in history, politics, music and tech, if you need to know what parts to get for a gaming PC I'm the guy to ask.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and to a lesser degree R in school although I only really use LUA in my free time due to its predominance in easily moddable games.
- ðŸ”¨ I contribute to the Road to 56 mod for HOI IV and previously (for the most part) created many mods for PAYDAY 2 and a couple for Fallout 3/NV/4 among others.

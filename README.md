- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @marijn2112 or normally known as marijn211
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in history, politics, music and tech, if you need to know what parts to get for a gaming PC I'm the guy to ask.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and C++ in school although in my free time I've mostly used LUA due to its predominance in easily moddable games aside from a couple Python-based and Batch-based utilities.
- ðŸ”¨ I contribute to the Road to 56 mod for HOI IV and previously (for the most part) created many mods for PAYDAY 2 and a couple for Fallout 3/NV/4 among others.
I would like to make Bannerlord, Rimworld and Freeman Guerrila Warfare mods but its in C/with dll's/bad systems etc. so Id be a pain since Im not too pro at coding.
